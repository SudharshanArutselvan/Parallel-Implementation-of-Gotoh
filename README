PARALLEL IMPLEMENTATION OF GOTOH ALGORITHM
OpenMP

To compile the program:

gcc -std=c99 -O3 -fopenmp gotoh.c main.c -o align

To run the OpenMP Gotoh Algorithm:

If running in the HPC cluster run "qsub gotoh.sh"
	This command runs the program 5 times and the number of cores can be changed in it.

If running in another machine, run
	./align sequence1.fasta sequence2.fasta

CUDA
Source files included in CUDA IMPLEMENTATION folder
- Submit the job cuda.sh
- sequence3.fasta and sequence4.fasta are the source sequence files, each of length 5520

//Additional source file main6.cu attached
Whereas main5.cu only has a blocked approach for 2*2 new computations per block, main6.cu is the generalized version to allow n*n computations.
Compiles, runs. Minor error left to debug.
